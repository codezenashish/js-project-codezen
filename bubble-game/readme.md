## üìö What I Learned

This was a great learning project for DOM and event handling in JavaScript.  
I learned:

- `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` for generating random numbers  
- Using `addEventListener` for handling click events  
- Working with `innerHTML`, `textContent`, and class selectors  
- Updating the DOM dynamically based on logic  
- Using `setInterval()` and `clearInterval()` for game timers

- üß† Add difficulty levels  
- üîÅ Restart game button  
- üèÜ Save and show high score
